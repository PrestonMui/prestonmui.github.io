abstract: 'The Federal Reserve has given job vacancy data center stage in assessing the strength of the labor market. The theoretical and empirical issues with vacancies data show that this is a mistake. Worse, it is a mistake that embeds a clear directional bias today. While labor market indicators in general show a strong labor market recovery from the pandemic recession, vacancies-based metrics portray a far tighter labor market than other indicators. If the Fed fixates on openings, they are setting themselves up to deliver substantially more policy tightening than is warranted by more traditional – and reliable – indicators'
