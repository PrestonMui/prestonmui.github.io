abstract: 'We examine the question of whether monetary policy constrains the supply-side, and what that means for inflation. Powell is reluctant to discuss the issue head-on, but recent research suggests that monetary tightening has long-run negative effects on output, capital, and productivity. One explanation for this phenomenon is that tightening has substantial effects on investment in innovation, which can reduce supply in the long-run and work against the Fed on inflation in the medium-term. Fiscal policy can help by supporting innovation investment when monetary policy is tight. Recent data do indeed show a slowdown in private innovation investment since the Fed started to raise interest rates. This bodes poorly for longer-term prospects for growth and inflation, and weakens the case for higher interest rates. Fiscal policy has an opportunity to alleviate these stresses through the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.'
