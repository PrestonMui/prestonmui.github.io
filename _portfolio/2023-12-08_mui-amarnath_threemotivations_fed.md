abstract: 'While policymakers were never fully convinced of the arguments in favor of a hard landing, they still saw a recessionary increase in unemployment as a requirement for disinflation at the beginning of this year. In the months since, the Fed has backed away from this view, and has expressed increasing confidence in the possibility of a soft landing. In this piece, we look forward to the Fed’s game plan in 2024 as longtime advocates for supply-side disinflation and a soft landing for the labor market. Now that the Fed shares these goals, what risks lay ahead and what steps must they take to preserve the hard-earned recovery in the labor market? We present a path for the Fed in 2024.'
