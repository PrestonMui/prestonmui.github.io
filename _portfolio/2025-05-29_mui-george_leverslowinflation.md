abstract: 'President Trump hasn’t been shy about repeatedly calling for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. If you were a lawmaker or policymaker outside the Fed, how would you try to lower inflation and, as a result, lower interest rates? There is an obvious — but underappreciated — sector to look for anti-inflationary fiscal policy: healthcare.'
