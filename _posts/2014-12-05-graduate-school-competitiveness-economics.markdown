I'm currently applying to PhD programs in Economics, and I've been told by older economists that the field of applicants has become much more competitive over recent years.
Now, some of this may be due to the financial crisis (where some students who may have gone to finance or consulting decide to go to academia instead), but there appears to be a secular component as well.

By "more competitive", I loosely mean that the quality of applicant profiles, especially at the top end, has gone up dramatically.
For example, more and more applicants are coming from overseas with master's degrees.
Domestically, many applicants have already taken some PhD classes while doing their undergraduate degree.
Having an A in analysis is standard and expected.
More candidates are doing RA work before applying.

The last point is the one I want to focus on.
I'm actually part of this trend, since instead of applying to graduate school straight out of Georgetown, I'm taking two years off to work as a research analyst at the NYFed.
RAing before grad school applications has a couple advantages: you get to develop relationships with economists who can write letters of recommendation, you get a chance to get research experience, and you have some time to take some extra classes to boost your profile.
However, most RA jobs are doing empirical work: cleaning data, programming regressions, and other Stata monkeywork.
There just isn't a lot of RA work in doing theory.
From an applicant standpoint, it's simply easier to (a) develop skills in this empirical research as an undergraduate and (b) signal skills in empirical research rather than theory.

I think this is because original work in theory is simply *harder* to do than original work in empirical economics if you're an undergraduate.
When I was doing my senior thesis (I wrote a labor search theory paper), my professors discouraged me from doing theory.
Their reasoning was the following: if you do empirics, in the end you can still run a regression and even if you don't find any statistical significance, that's a result.
If you do theory, your problem might turn out not to be tractable and in the end you have nothing.
So, if you're an enterprising young undergraduate who is interested in signalling talent to grad schools, the incentives are skewed towards doing empirical work.

I wonder if the increased competitiveness of economics graduate school applications is going to contribute to a greater emphasis on empirical work and fewer people working on theory later on in their careers.
I imagine the effect is not too large; after all, even if someone enters graduate school wanting to do empirical work, five to six years is a long time.
You learn a lot (I imagine) of theory in your classes, and theory gets relatively easier.
If there is an effect, it's probably swamped by the effect of new datasets and more computing power is having on the future of economics.
But I think it's important to consider this possibility.
