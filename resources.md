Here are some resouces I've found helpful.

**Software I Use**

[Linux Mint][linuxmint]: This is my OS of choice. I use the Cinnamon desktop.

[Julia][julialang]: Julia is a "high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing."
Its syntax and feel are similar to Python and Matlab, but is faster than Python (out of the box) and cheaper than Matlab (free).
See [this paper](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/comparison_languages.pdf) for a comparison of programming languages in economics that includes Julia.

[Sublime Text][sublime]: My favorite text editor. Tons of plugins and features. I use the IJulia, Stata Enhanced, and LaTexing plugins.

[Inkscape][inkscape]: Make pretty charts for your papers or classes.

[Mendeley][mendeley]: Organize your collection of academic papers (if you have a Kindle, you can use [KinSync][kinsync] to push your Mendeley collections to your Kindle).

**Other useful sites**

[Paul's Online Math Notes][paul]: Useful shoring up your Calc I-III, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra (also useful for helping you get through these courses)

[Code and Data for the Social Sciences][code], by Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro: Very, very useful guide to data management, coding best practices, etc. A must-read!

[Quantitative Economics][quantecon] by John Stachurski and Thomas Sargent.
