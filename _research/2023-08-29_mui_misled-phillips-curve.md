abstract: 'Predictions that fighting inflation would require an increase in the unemployment rate went wrong. The flaws in these predictions can be traced back to three ideas: first, that vacancies are a good measure of labor market tightness; second, that inflation expectations posed a threat to inflation stability, and third, the reliance on the Phillips curve framework, which emphasizes a story around labor market pressures on inflation instead of supply-side stories. In this piece, I dive deeper into the finer details of two of the models behind those predictions. I show how their projections differed from reality and why the mechanisms of those models failed to predict the disinflation we’ve seen over the past year, even as the unemployment rate remained low.
