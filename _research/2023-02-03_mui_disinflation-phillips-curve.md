abstract: 'Ball, Leigh and Mishra (2022) warned that the Fed’s inflation target was not likely to be achieved without substantial increases in unemployment or extremely optimistic assumptions.  Since the paper was released, unemployment has remained low, vacancies have remained high, but inflation in both prices and wages came down quickly. Acknowledging that the model did not make unconditional predictions about inflation, I feed in the realized path of the variables that supposedly explain inflation, which the authors did not know at the time. Even with full access to the data since the time of publishing, the model does not predict the rapid disinflation that happened in 2022 Q4. While the path to returning to 2% inflation is likely to remain bumpy in the upcoming months, the fact that the model with full information does not forecast any disinflation should cast serious doubt on the use of reductive Phillips curve thinking in setting policy during this pivotal time, especially when the model calls for a substantial increase in joblessness to achieve disinflation.'
