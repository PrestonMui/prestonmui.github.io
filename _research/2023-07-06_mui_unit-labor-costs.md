abstract: 'Our view is that the “unit labor cost” measure is simply not a useful way of assessing the extent of labor cost pressures on inflation. One part of the ULC is just a price index, the growth of which is simply inflation itself; the other component, the labor share, does not have any clear relationship, whether in terms of its outright level or its growth rate, with inflation. In historical context, the labor share is low and has been declining over the past two years, and a non-inflationary recovery in labor shares is not out of the historical norm.'
