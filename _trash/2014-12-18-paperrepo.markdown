My colleague Matt Cocci recently put together a very cool tool which he calls [PaperRepo][paperrepo]. The idea is pretty simple: You create one BibTeX file for all the papers you find interesting, and then compile all those references (with annotations) into one PDF file.

I think this could be a useful complement to [Mendeley][mendeley], since Mendeley will export all of your citations and annotations into a BibTeX file.

Anyways, check it out.
