Hi there! Welcome to my website. Please do excuse the clutter for now, I'm still getting used to working with Jekyll and Git.

Obviously this is the first post so blog-wise there's nothing to read, but above and to the right there should be links to my CV, a quick bio, and a short list of useful resources.
