I am currently a Senior Economist at [Employ America](https://www.employamerica.org/), a macroeconomic research and advocacy organization that promotes full-employment as a policy goal. At Employ America, I write about labor market developments, productivity growth, inflation management, and Federal Reserve policy. I frequently interact with policymakers and journalists. I have been interviewed by NPR Marketplace, Axios, the New York Times, the Associated Press, and more.

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley in 2022 with a focus on Macroeconomics and Labor Economics.

I race road and track cycling for [Liquid Velo](https://www.liquidvelo.org/). I was the organizer of the [Berkeley Omnium](https://berkeleybikeclub.org/2026-berkeley-omnium) from 2022 to 2023 and the founder of the Berkeley Streets Criterium. I have seen 787 species of birds.
