Welcome to my personal website.
I am currently a Senior Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in the International Research division.
I received my B.A. from Georgetown University in 2013 and I currently reside in the Lower East Side in New York City.
My research interests lie in international trade, labor, and industrial organization.
