Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Senior Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in the International Research division. I received my B.A. from Georgetown University in 2013. Currently I reside in the Lower East Side of New York City.

My research interests lie in international trade, macro labor, and search theory.
